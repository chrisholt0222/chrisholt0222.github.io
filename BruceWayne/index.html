  <h2>Summary of Bruce Wayne</h2>

  <p>
    Bruce Wayne is a mild manner dog and owner of many dog toys. He was rescued from the human society 
      several years ago and lives with his family in Chamblee, GA. After settling in with his new family
      (eating the shutters), he sleeps about 18 hours a day. Due to his earlier life on the streets, 
      Bruce swore vengeance against other dogs and shows them no mercy. Bruce trains himself 
      physically and mentally and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime (other dogs and the cat).

  <p>
      Batman operates in the real Chamblee City with assistance from his family. Unlike most superheroes, 
      Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a genius-level intellect 
      for a dog, is a peerless licker, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of weaponry 
      and equipment. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, 
      pepper an old blind dog.
